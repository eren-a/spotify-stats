# Check your own Spotify stats!

Does not work, I have to manually add the users e-mail to my spotify api dashboard for them to use the website. Check out the [Demo!](https://eren-a.github.io/spotify-stats-demo/)

This project is a web application that allows users to view their top artists and tracks on Spotify based on different time ranges (short-term, mid-term, and long-term). The application utilizes the Spotify Web API to fetch user data and display it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

**Time Range Selection**: Users can choose between short-term, mid-term, and long-term time ranges to view their top artists and tracks.

**Limit Input**: Users can specify the number of top artists or tracks they want to display using a limit input field.

**Top Artists Display**: The application fetches and displays the user's top artists, including their names and profile images. Clicking on an artist's image opens the corresponding Spotify artist page.

**Top Tracks Display**: The application fetches and displays the user's top tracks, including track names, artists, and album cover images. Clicking on a track's image opens the corresponding Spotify track page.

## How to Use
